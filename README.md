## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- use margin instead of padding in image div to make the border radius of image more effictive


### Continued development

- footer outside the main div 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp) - This helped me for image overlay reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
